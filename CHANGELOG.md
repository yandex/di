# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

While the major version is 0, a minor bump may change behaviour. Each entry
below says plainly whether an upgrade can break a caller.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.20.0] - 2026-10-10

`dihttp.Serve` and `digrpc.Serve` take a second server. `go doc -all`
against 0.19.1 is unchanged in `di` and `dislog`; in `dihttp`, `Serve`
gains a type parameter. Every call site compiles unchanged. **An upgrade
can break a caller** that takes either `Serve` as a function value without
instantiating it.

### Changed

- `dihttp.Serve` is generic over the binding's key, `Serve[S ~*http.Server]`,
  so a second server in one scope is registered under a type of its own,
  `type AdminServer *http.Server`, and served by the same call; a
  constructor returning `*http.Server` still serves it. `digrpc.Serve` is
  the same over `*grpc.Server`, in `digrpc/v0.5.0`, which requires this
  release.
- `digrpc/v0.4.0` (2026-10-07) requires grpc v1.80.0 rather than v1.84.0,
  so it fits an application that is not on the latest grpc.

### Fixed

- A key that is a named type over a pointer, `type AdminServer *http.Server`,
  was reported by its underlying type, `*net/http.Server` in package
  `net/http`, in events, `Explain`, `Graph`, `Modules` and every rejection,
  so two such servers read as one. It is now named by its own name and
  package.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-10-03

A fix to `dihttp.Serve`, and the gRPC adapter's own `Serve`. `go doc -all`
against 0.19.0 is unchanged in `di`, `dihttp` and `dislog`. An upgrade
cannot break a caller.

### Added

- In `digrpc/v0.3.0`, which requires `di` v0.19.0: `digrpc.Serve(b,
  listen)` gives a `*grpc.Server` binding its whole lifecycle, as
  `dihttp.Serve` does for net/http: eager, `listen` called in `OnStart`,
  served from a worker once `Ready` closes, `GracefulStop` in `OnDrain`
  bounded by the stop context, `Stop` in `OnStop`. `examples/grpc` uses it.

### Fixed

- `dihttp.Serve`'s worker closes the server when it is cancelled, so a
  teardown that skipped the drain (an instance built into a scope whose
  drain phase had already ended) no longer leaves it serving with `OnStop`
  waiting on the worker for ever.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-10-03

A barrier for serving once the whole start has succeeded, and the net/http
adapter's use of it. `go doc -all` against 0.18.0 only adds: `Scope.Ready`
and `Binding.Scope` in `di`, `Serve` in `dihttp`; `dislog` is unchanged. An
upgrade cannot break a caller.

### Added

- `Scope.Ready` returns a channel closed once the nearest `Start` at or
  above the scope (or `Run`'s start) returns nil, and never when it fails.
  A worker starts with its own service, while later services may still be
  starting; a server that binds in `OnStart` and serves from its worker
  after `Ready` serves no request from a start that then rolls back.
  `examples/server` and `examples/grpc` do so.
- `dihttp.Serve(b)` gives an `*http.Server` binding its whole lifecycle: it
  makes it eager, binds in `OnStart`, serves from a worker once `Ready`
  closes (with `ServeTLS` when the server has a `TLSConfig`), shuts down in
  `OnDrain` and closes in `OnStop`, and fills in a port of 0 in `Addr`.
  The guide's API server uses it.
- `Binding.Scope` returns the scope a binding was registered through, for
  code that adds hooks needing it, as `dihttp.Serve` does.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-09-24

Three races that could leave a key two live values are closed, and a warm
resolution got several times faster. `go doc -all` against 0.17.2 is
unchanged in `di` and `dislog`; in `dihttp` one doc comment is reworded.
**An upgrade can break a caller** in one case: a resolution that fails now
leaves its route claimed, so a scope below the owner that tried to resolve a
key refuses a fallback registration of it afterwards (see Fixed). A
registration racing a resolution or a `Wrap` of the same key may now be
refused where it used to commit into an inconsistent state.

### Changed

- A warm `Get` no longer writes to the registration it reads. Every
  resolution stored the "resolved" mark again, on the cache line the value is
  read from, so cores resolving the same singleton kept invalidating each
  other.
- A warm `Get` no longer allocates. It made two resolution-path nodes, one
  for the top-level call and one for the service, that nothing reads once
  the value is built. Together with the entry above, on an M3 Max: a warm
  `Get` went from 38 ns, 64 B and 2 allocations to 21 ns and none, and at
  eight cores from 56 ns to about 3 ns, or from 61 ns to about 6 ns through a
  child scope.
- A `Get` through nested scopes no longer locks every scope between the
  resolving one and the owner each time. Recording that the key was handed
  down now stops at the first scope already recorded as handing it down from
  the same owner or one further out, so a request scope under a shared middle
  scope takes that scope's mutex once per key rather than on every `Get`:
  repeated warm `Get`s went from 181 ns at eight cores to about 8 ns
  (`BenchmarkDI_Parallel_NestedGet`).
- A child scope is smaller and cheaper to open: 256 bytes rather than 288,
  and one allocation where there were three, since what only `Run` and
  `Shutdown` use, and the map only a `Scoped` binding needs, are made when
  first needed. Opening and stopping an empty child takes 6 allocations
  instead of 8.

### Fixed

- In `digrpc/v0.2.2`: `Register` no longer panics on every unary call to a
  method whose proto name is not its Go name (`rpc get_user`, served by
  `GetUser`); it looked the Go method up by the proto name. The generated
  handler now makes the typed call itself, with no reflection per call.
- A `Wrap` racing another registration of the key it wraps can no longer
  leave two live values for the key or drop a registration unseen: an
  `Override` of the target could commit between `Wrap` finding it and
  marking it, and the wrapper went on serving a value built from a
  registration nothing else could reach; a registration, or another `Wrap`,
  landing in the wrapper's own scope meanwhile was silently displaced. `Wrap`
  now panics with a configuration error naming the registration it lost to
  (#52).
- A `Wrap` over a registration that is marked `Group()` only afterwards is
  now rejected at the next resolution, as it already was when the
  registration was a group member before `Wrap` ran. It used to commit, so
  `Get` served the wrapper while `All` still returned the unwrapped member.
- An `Override` committed concurrently with the first resolution of the
  registration it replaces can no longer let both through. The resolution
  could hand out the old value while the `Override` committed, leaving the
  key two live values; now one of them waits for the other, so either the
  resolution serves the new registration or the `Override` is rejected as
  already resolved. Found by review, not reported.
- A registration in a scope between a resolving scope and the owner it
  resolves from, made while that resolution was building, no longer leaves
  the resolving scope with two values for the key: the first `Get` kept the
  ancestor's value and every later one got the new registration. The route
  is now claimed before the build, so such a registration is rejected as the
  scope having already resolved the key, and one committed before the claim
  reaches it is found and served instead. The same held beside and through a
  `Wrap`. **A resolution that fails now leaves its route claimed as well**, so
  a scope below the owner that tried to resolve the key refuses a fallback
  registration of it afterwards; register the fallback before resolving, or
  in the owner.

## [0.17.2] - 2026-09-23

The first release under `golang.yandex/di`. `go doc -all` against 0.17.1
changes one line per package — the import path — and nothing else: no
identifier, signature or behaviour differs in `di`, `dihttp` or `dislog`.
**The upgrade breaks every caller all the same**, because the module path
moved; the recipe below is the whole of the edit.

### Added

- `digrpc`, the gRPC counterpart of `dihttp`, as a separate module so the
  library keeps no dependency: `digrpc.Interceptor` opens a child scope per
  call holding a `*digrpc.Call`, `digrpc.Module` provides it, and
  `Interceptor.Options()` gives the server options. It is versioned on its
  own, as `digrpc/vX.Y.Z`.
- `digrpc.Register[H](srv, desc)`, in `digrpc/v0.2.0`, serves a generated
  service with an `H` resolved from each call's scope: the implementation is
  `Scoped` when it takes the call, is built after the server's interceptors
  have run, and a constructor's status error fails the call with that status.

### Changed

- **The module path is now `golang.yandex/di`**, and `dihttp`, `dislog` and
  `digrpc` move with it. This breaks every caller: change the `go.mod`
  requirement and the imports together, since the old and new paths are two
  modules as far as the toolchain is concerned and a build graph containing
  both would link two copies of the container. No identifier, signature or
  behaviour changed, so the edit is the path and nothing else:

      grep -rl '"github.com/floatdrop/di' --include='*.go' . \
        | xargs -r perl -pi -e 's{"github\.com/floatdrop/di(?=[/"])}{"golang.yandex/di}g'
      gofmt -w .   # the new path sorts elsewhere in a mixed import block
      go mod tidy  # drops the old requirement, adds the new one

  The rewrite is anchored on the opening quote and on the end of the path
  element, so it touches import paths only and leaves a
  `github.com/floatdrop/dispatch` alone. `go mod tidy` last, rather than a
  `go get` first, because `dihttp`, `dislog` and `digrpc` move in the same
  edit and it works out which of them a caller imports.

  A service's reported name carries its package path, so anything asserting on
  `Explain`, `Graph`, `Modules` or an `Event.Service` of a type declared in
  this module sees the new prefix.

- **The repository moved to <https://github.com/yandex/di>**, and the guide
  with it, to <https://yandex.github.io/di/>. GitHub redirects the old
  location, so a remote, a clone or a link still works; nothing about the
  library does.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-09-19

`go doc -all` against 0.17.0 adds `dihttp.HandleFunc` and changes nothing
else; nothing breaks.

### Added

- `dihttp.HandleFunc(method)` is `dihttp.Handle` as an `http.HandlerFunc`, for
  routers whose route methods take one rather than an `http.Handler`:
  `r.Get("/users/{id}", dihttp.HandleFunc((*Users).Show))` on a chi router.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-18

What a comparison with `uber/fx` turned up: a group or optional parameter can
be declared rather than resolved from a closure, `Run` bounds its start, a
binding carries one hook of each kind, and `Explain` reports what wiring
something late cost.

`go doc -all` against 0.16.2 adds `Binding.Needs`, `Need`, `Optional`, `AllOf`
and `StartTimeout`, and changes no signature and removes nothing, in `di`,
`dihttp` and `dislog` alike. **Two behaviour changes can break a caller**: a
binding that sets one hook of a kind twice now panics rather than keeping the
last one, and a `Run` whose start takes more than 15 seconds now fails and
rolls back, so a start that legitimately takes longer must say
`StartTimeout`.

### Added

- `Binding.Needs`, with `Optional[T]()` and `AllOf[T]()`, declares the two
  parameters a constructor's signature cannot describe on its own:

      // func NewRouter(rs []Route, t *Tracer) *Router
      s.Wire[*Router](NewRouter).Needs(di.AllOf[Route](), di.Optional[*Tracer]())

  `AllOf[T]` fills a `[]T` with the group for T, exactly as `All[T]()` does —
  read where the constructor runs, so a `Scoped` consumer sees the members its
  own scope adds, and the nil slice when the group is empty. `Optional[T]`
  fills a T if anything provides it and the zero value if nothing does, as
  `Maybe[T]()` does. Each `Need` is matched to its parameter by type, so
  parameter order stays the constructor's business; a `Need` that matches no
  parameter is rejected, as is a parameter described twice, and so is `Needs`
  on anything but a `Wire` or `Wrap` registration.

  Both were already possible through a `Provide` closure calling `All` or
  `Maybe`. What the markers add is that the dependency stays declared: the
  constructor remains a plain function, `Validate` checks it — walking a group
  member by member, and treating an unprovided optional as no failure —
  `Explain` draws it before anything is built, and `Modules` lists it. A
  closure took the whole constructor out of the checked graph for the sake of
  one parameter.
- `StartTimeout` bounds `Run`'s start phase as `StopTimeout` bounds its stop,
  and is 15 seconds by default: the context the `OnStart` hooks receive
  expires after it, the start ends between steps once it has, and the rollback
  runs. `StartTimeout(0)` takes the bound off, leaving the start bounded only
  by the context passed to `Run`, as it was before.
  A `Run` whose start legitimately takes longer than 15 seconds, such as one
  that migrates a database in an `OnStart`, must now say so. An `OnStart` hook
  that keeps its context for work outliving the start must take
  `Scope.Context` instead: under `Run` the one it is given is cancelled when
  the start ends.
  The deadline belongs to the phase and to nothing else. A constructor reads
  `Scope.Context`, which is still the context `Run` was called with, and a
  worker's context lasts as long as its service. It is checked between the
  steps `Start` drives, so it does not reach a service resolved from inside a
  start hook: that one is built and started there and then, on the scope's
  context, and a hook waiting on it is as unbounded as before.
- `Explain` reports the values that were built on an answer that has since
  changed: `missed by: *app.Router in root`. Two questions get that treatment,
  `Maybe[T]`, when T was registered afterwards, and `All[T]`, when a member
  was. Both ask about the scope chain as it stands — a child scope may answer
  either differently — so registering late is not rejected, and it used to be
  silent instead. It is the answer to why a dependency or a group member that
  looks registered is not reaching the service that wanted it. Only an asker
  whose chain reached the scope the registration landed in is listed; one that
  asked from a sibling branch was never going to see it, and an ask made
  outside a constructor is not recorded at all, since no value was built on it.

### Fixed

- A second `OnStart`, `OnDrain`, `OnStop` or `Go` on one binding is rejected,
  naming the registration and the site of the second call. It used to assign
  over the first, so of two `OnStop` hooks only the last ran and nothing said
  that the other release had been dropped. A binding still carries one hook of
  each kind: combine them into one function, where the order within is the
  caller's.
- `Start` no longer starts anything once its context's deadline has passed.
  Cancellation is unchanged: a cancelled context still finishes the start, so
  the rollback has everything to undo, which is how `Run` has always treated a
  signal during a slow start.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-09-13

A faster warm path and four lifecycle fixes. `go doc -all` against 0.16.1 is
unchanged in `di`, `dihttp` and `dislog` apart from the package doc's own
text; an upgrade cannot break a caller.

### Changed

- A warm resolution, of a service that is already built, no longer takes a
  mutex in the scope that owns it, and observers are called without one.
  Every `Get` of an application singleton used to serialise on the
  application scope, so it got slower per call as cores were added: 46 ns on
  one core and 418 ns on eight, on an M3 Max. It is now 44 ns and 55 ns, and
  a whole request scope at eight cores went from 2.3 µs to 1.4 µs.
  No API or behaviour changes; the new `benchmarks/parallel_test.go` records
  the shapes.
- The cycle check a resolution makes before waiting on another goroutine's
  build no longer scans every waiting resolution in the container. Many
  resolutions arriving at one slow constructor made it quadratic under the
  container's one lock: 8192 of them took over 300 ms to settle and now take
  about 20 ms on an M3 Max (`BenchmarkDI_Herd_8192` in
  `benchmarks/parallel_test.go`).

### Fixed

- A `Wrap` in a child scope no longer keeps the parent's registration from
  being overridden after the child has stopped. The parent's `Override()` was
  rejected as "wrapped at" a site in a scope that no longer existed. The same
  held after the child overrode its own wrapper. A wrapper in a live scope
  still guards what it wraps, including when a sibling scope that wrapped the
  same registration has stopped.
- A service that was built and waiting for its start step when a drain swept
  past it now gets its `OnDrain` once it starts. The sweep decided it owed
  nothing, since it had not started, and made that final, so a `Stop` issued
  while `Start` was still starting earlier services released it with `OnStop`
  and no `OnDrain`. The drain phase also no longer misses a service built
  between its last sweep and the scope being marked stopped: the phase ends
  only when nothing in the scope's subtree has been built or started since
  that sweep began. So a `Stop` goes round again while anything below
  it is still being built or started, and under work that never quiets it
  returns when its context expires.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-09-12

One fix. `go doc -all` against 0.16.0 is unchanged in `di`, `dihttp` and
`dislog`; an upgrade cannot break a caller.

### Fixed

- A worker registered with `Go` that panics is now a worker that failed: the
  panic becomes its error, `Shutdown` receives it, `Run` returns it, `OnStop`
  runs and the stop event carries it, as for a panicking hook. It was the one
  user function not called through the recovering wrapper, so its panic took
  the process down with no release and no event.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-10

`Binding.Worker` is now `Binding.Go`, after `errgroup.Group.Go` and
`sync.WaitGroup.Go`, whose contract it has always had: run a function in a
goroutine the group tracks, cancel it when the group winds down, wait for it,
and let its error take the group down. `go doc -all` against 0.15.1 removes
`Binding.Worker` and adds `Binding.Go` with the same signature. **An upgrade
breaks a caller that registers a worker**: rename the call from `Worker` to
`Go`, and nothing else changes.

### Changed

- `Binding.Worker` is renamed `Binding.Go`, with no alias left behind. The
  word "worker" still names what the method registers, in the docs and in the
  one error `Stop` reports about it, which now reads "worker did not return"
  rather than "Worker hook did not return".

## [0.15.1] - 2026-09-10

A code-organisation release: the library is six files rather than one, and
the one observability gap the reorganisation turned up is closed. `go doc
-all` against 0.15.0 changes doc comments only and no signature; `dihttp` and
`dislog` are untouched. An upgrade cannot break a caller.

### Fixed

- A panicking `OnStart` hook reports its `EventStart`, with the panic as
  `Err`, the way a panicking `OnDrain` or `OnStop` hook already reported
  theirs. Observers saw no start step at all for such a service; the failure
  still reached `Start` and `Resolve` as before.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-10

An application can say what it is doing. `go doc -all` against 0.14.0 adds one
field to `Event`, leaves every signature alone and leaves `dihttp` untouched;
`dislog` is a new package beside it. An upgrade cannot break a caller unless
it built an `Event` with an unkeyed composite literal.

### Added

- `dislog`, a new package that logs a scope's lifecycle events through
  `log/slog`: `app.Observe(dislog.New(logger))` gives one line per constructor
  and per hook, so an application says what it is doing as it builds, starts,
  drains and stops. The event's kind is the message; the service, its scope,
  the module it came from and the duration are attributes. A step that failed
  logs at `slog.LevelError` with the error and the registration site, a step
  that succeeded at `slog.LevelInfo` or wherever `dislog.Level` puts it, and
  `dislog.Site()` logs the site every time. A service is named the way it is
  written in Go, with the import path lifted out into a `pkg` attribute. The
  package imports nothing beyond `log/slog` and `di`, so the library stays
  dependency-free and any handler will do; `examples/` uses
  `charmbracelet/log`.
- `Event.Package`, the import path of the type `Event.Service` names, so an
  observer can shorten a service name or group by its package without parsing
  one. It walks through pointers, since a pointer type is unnamed and carries
  no path of its own, and is empty for a key whose type is unnamed -- a
  `[]byte`, a `map[string]int` -- because reflect already writes those with a
  short package name. An upgrade can break a caller only if it built an
  `Event` with an unkeyed composite literal, which `go vet`'s composites check
  reports.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-07

A module dependency report, derived from what registrations already carry.
`go doc -all` against 0.13.1 adds `Scope.Modules` and changes no signature;
an upgrade cannot break a caller.

### Added

- `Scope.Modules()` renders the modules registered into a scope and its
  ancestors: what each provides, what it needs and which module serves it,
  what it wraps, and which of its constructors are closures whose needs are
  known only when they run. A need only a resolving scope can provide is
  reported as owed, as `Validate` reports it, and a module's dependency on its
  own services is left out. It is derived from what registrations already
  carry, the module label and the parameters `Wire` declares, so there is
  nothing to declare twice. Keys are named by their package rather than their
  import path, to read beside the module labels.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-09-07

Three defects reported in [#35], each with a reproduction, each real. `go
doc -all` against 0.13.0 is unchanged in `di` and `dihttp`; an upgrade cannot
break a caller, and every fix turns a panic, a false rejection or a lost
error into the behaviour the documentation already promised.

### Fixed

- `Wire` and `Wrap` accepted a result merely assignable to the key, such as a
  `chan int` for a `<-chan int` key or a `[]byte` for a named slice type, and
  then stored it as the constructor's own type, so `Get` panicked asserting
  it. The value is stored as the key's type now ([#35]).
- `Validate` reported a cycle where a valid graph visited one `Scoped`
  binding in two scopes. A node on its path is now a binding in a holder, as
  it is on a resolution path at run time, so the two instances are told
  apart ([#35]).
- A `Worker` that returned its own failure joined with the cancellation, as
  `errors.Join(ctx.Err(), err)`, had the failure dropped with the
  cancellation, and `Stop` returned nil. Only an error that says nothing
  beyond the cancellation is dropped now ([#35]).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-06

One route, one line. `go doc -all` against 0.12.0 leaves `di` untouched and
adds `dihttp.Handle`; nothing changes shape or behaviour, and an upgrade
cannot break a caller.

### Added

- `dihttp.Handle(method)` makes an `http.Handler` that resolves a handler
  type from the request's scope and calls one of its methods, named by a
  method expression: `mux.Handle("GET /users/{id}", dihttp.Handle((*Users).Show))`.
  One type per resource with a method per route replaces a type, a
  registration and a closure per route. The type is `Scoped` when it needs
  the request and a plain singleton when it does not; `Handle` follows
  either. Nothing existing changes; an upgrade cannot break a caller.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-06

The request-scope middleware becomes a dependency a server's constructor can
take, so an application needs no `Provide` closure to serve HTTP. `go doc
-all` against 0.11.0 leaves `di` untouched and changes `dihttp`: `Middleware`
is now the type, `NewMiddleware` makes one, `Module` registers one. The rename
is the breaking change, and the reason for the minor bump.

### Changed

- `dihttp.Middleware` is now the type, `func(http.Handler) http.Handler`, so
  a server's constructor can take one as a parameter; the function that
  makes one is `dihttp.NewMiddleware`. A call `dihttp.Middleware(app)` no
  longer compiles: rename it, or take the middleware as a dependency.

### Added

- `dihttp.Module` registers a `Middleware` over the scope it is applied to.
  With it the guide's server is a wired constructor with its dependencies
  declared, and the guide application uses no `Provide` closure at all.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-06

`Validate` no longer needs an adapter to check request scopes: the caller
says what such a scope will hold. `go doc -all` against 0.10.0 adds `Stub`
and `Provided`, gives `Scope.Validate` a variadic parameter, which every
existing call satisfies, and removes `dihttp.Validate`, the one breaking
change.

### Added

- `di.Provided[T]()` makes a `Stub`, a key the scope resolving a `Scoped`
  binding will provide. `s.Validate(stubs...)` then makes the check that scope
  would make: what the stubs cover is satisfied, and what neither the scope
  nor the stubs provide is an error rather than `Owed`. Stubs apply to the
  `Scoped` path only; a singleton that would build a `Scoped` service in its
  own scope still fails there, whatever a request scope holds.

### Removed

- `dihttp.Validate`, which opened a throwaway request scope to do what
  `app.Validate(di.Provided[*http.Request]())` now does from the application
  scope, without an HTTP-shaped helper in the way. Replace the call with that
  expression and `.Err()`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-06

A service can be wrapped without being replaced ([#1]), which was the last
open issue and the gap most often felt next to uber/fx. `go doc -all`
against 0.9.1 adds `Scope.Wrap` and changes no signature; an upgrade cannot
break a caller, since every new rejection involves a wrapper.

### Added

- `Scope.Wrap[T](fn)` composes over whatever serves `T` when it is called,
  the latest registration in this scope or the one an ancestor provides
  ([#1]). `fn` takes the wrapped value first and its other dependencies after
  it, read with reflection as `Wire` reads a constructor, and returns `T` or
  `(T, error)`. What is wrapped keeps its registration, hooks and lifetime, is
  built first and stopped after the wrapper; wrappers chain in registration
  order; a wrapper takes the wrapped lifetime, and `Scoped()` on it makes one
  per resolving scope over a shared inner. A wrapper in a child scope applies
  to that scope and its descendants only, which is what uber/fx calls
  `Decorate`. Nothing to wrap, a group, and the `Group()` or `Override()`
  markers on a wrapper are rejected. A registration some wrapper composes
  over can no longer be overridden, in its scope or a descendant's, until an
  `Override()` replaces the wrapper itself. `Explain` names a wrapper and
  draws what it wraps beneath it; `Validate` walks the chain.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-06

`Explain` shows the graph `Wire` declared before it is built. `go doc -all`
against 0.9.0 adds no symbol and changes no signature, and an upgrade cannot
break a caller; only the rendering of an unbuilt `Wire` service gains lines.

### Changed

- `Explain` draws the dependencies a `Wire` binding declares when it has not
  been built: dashed edges under the node, each continuing as the recorded
  tree where the dependency has been built and as a declared one where it has
  not, ending at a closure or at a key nothing provides. A `declared by:` line
  names the unbuilt services that declare a key, beside `needed by:` for the
  built ones. The output for a built service is unchanged, and `Graph` still
  renders only what was built.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-06

Constructors can be handed over as they are written, and the graph they
declare can be checked before anything is built ([#3]). Nothing existing
changes shape or behaviour; an upgrade cannot break a caller.

`go doc -all` against 0.8.0 adds `Scope.Wire`, `Scope.Validate`, `Validation`
with its `Err` method, and `dihttp.Validate`, and changes no signature. The
README no longer promises no reflection at all: `Wire` reads a constructor's
signature once at registration and calls it through `reflect.Call`; `Provide`
is as it was.

### Added

- `Scope.Wire[T](ctor)` registers a plain constructor, `func(A, B) T` or
  `func(A, B) (T, error)`, whose parameters are its dependencies. Each is
  resolved as a `Provide` closure would resolve it, from the same scope, so
  lifetimes, hooks, cycles and error paths are unchanged. The signature is
  read with reflection once at registration, where a constructor of the wrong
  shape is rejected like any other configuration error; a result merely
  assignable to `T` is accepted, so a concrete constructor can serve an
  interface key. The build calls the constructor through `reflect.Call`, about
  150ns and two allocations over a closure. `Provide` is untouched.
- `Scope.Validate()` walks the declared graph without building and returns a
  `Validation`: `Errors` (joined by `Err()`) for a dependency nothing provides,
  a cycle among `Wire` constructors, or a singleton that would build a `Scoped`
  service in a scope that cannot satisfy it; `Owed` for what a `Scoped`
  binding needs that the validating scope does not provide, since the scope
  resolving it may; `Unchecked` for the `Provide` closures.
- `dihttp.Validate(app)` validates from a throwaway request scope holding an
  `*http.Request`, so what a request scope would still miss is an error.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-06

Two features and one rule. `Explain` and `Graph` render the dependency graph as
it was actually built ([#2]). Modules compose by `Use`, with every registration
attributed to the module that made it ([#6]). And the rule that makes modules
safe to compose: a second registration of a key within one scope must say so
with `Override()`, or it is rejected naming both sites -- the one breaking
change here, and the reason for the minor bump.

`go doc -all` against 0.7.0 adds `Binding.Override`, `Module`, `Scope.Use`,
`Scope.Explain` and `Scope.Graph`, and changes one signature: `Test` takes
`...Module`. A call that passes function literals or named functions compiles
unchanged; one that spreads a `[]func(*Scope)` needs the slice typed
`[]Module`.

### Changed

- **A second registration of a key within one scope must be marked
  `Override()`.** An unmarked one is rejected at the next resolution, naming
  both registrations and, when they came from modules, both modules. The last
  registration used to win silently, which meant a module's internal wiring
  could be rerouted by an unrelated module that happened to provide the same
  type, and nothing said so. `Override()` is the intent made explicit, and it
  is the test seam now:

  ```go
  s := di.Test(t, app.Wire)
  s.Value(&DB{DSN: "sqlite://memory"}).Override()
  ```

  An `Override()` with nothing to override in its scope is rejected as well,
  since a fake for a service that has since been renamed would otherwise be a
  registration nobody resolves, and the test would pass against production
  wiring. A child scope still shadows its parent without any marker; that is a
  different registry, not a replacement. A key that has served a value still
  cannot be replaced at all, marker or not.

  **Upgrade:** add `.Override()` to every registration that deliberately
  replaces an earlier one in the same scope. The rejection message names both
  sites, so the compiler is not needed to find them: run the tests.
- `Test` takes `...Module` rather than `...func(*Scope)`. A function literal
  or a named function is assignable to `Module`, so a call that passes them
  directly compiles unchanged; one that spreads a `[]func(*Scope)` with `...`
  needs the slice typed `[]Module`. The wire functions are applied with `Use`,
  so registrations made in a test carry the module's name.

### Fixed

- A panicking `OnDrain` or `OnStop` hook is reported as that hook's failure
  instead of propagating out of `Stop`. The start step was always recovered
  this way; the other two were not, so a panic in either abandoned the
  teardown halfway -- `stopOnce` claimed and never settled, every later `Stop`
  waiting on it until its context ran out, and every instance behind it never
  released. The concurrent driver found it the moment it gained a shape that
  leaves a child scope with a permanently rejected registration: a drain hook
  resolving through that scope meets the rejection as a panic.

### Added

- **`Scope.Explain[T]` and `Scope.Graph`**, which answer what a service was
  built from and what needed it ([#2]). Constructors are closures, so the
  container learns a service's dependencies by watching it resolve them; each
  one is now recorded on the instance that asked, and the two methods render
  what has been built. `Explain` is a tree with each node's lifetime, scope,
  lifecycle state and registration site, followed by the instances that needed
  it, with a dependency reached twice expanded once. `Graph` is Graphviz DOT,
  one cluster per scope. Neither builds anything: a service that has not been
  resolved is reported with its registration and left alone.

  The recording costs nothing on the warm path. A resolution made outside a
  constructor has nobody to tell, and the test for that is a pointer
  comparison at the call site; a warm `Get` allocates what it did before.
  Building a four-service graph allocates one small slice per constructor that
  has dependencies.

  Not done, and not needed: the issue's optional dependency-aware `Stop`.
  Build order is already a valid reverse topological order, and nothing stops
  instances individually.

- `Module`, a named `func(*Scope)`, and `Scope.Use(mods ...Module)`, which
  applies modules in order and attributes every registration they make -- 
  directly, from a child the module opens, or later from a constructor the
  module registered -- to the module's function name. A collision then reads
  `*app.DB is provided at app.Storage (wire.go:12) and again at app.Caching
  (cache.go:8)`, and `Event.Module` carries the same name to observers.
  Modules composed by plain function calls still work exactly as before; they
  are simply unattributed.

### Internal

The API cuts of 0.7.0 left machinery behind that only the removed features
needed. Nothing here changes behaviour: `go doc -all` is identical to 0.7.0's,
and so is every error message and every event, checked by rendering each shape
built from a resolution path on both trees and diffing.

One measurable effect: a resolution path node is 32 bytes rather than 48, so a
warm resolve allocates 64 B rather than 96 B and runs about 8% faster
(42.2 ns to 38.7 ns on an Apple M3 Max). The README table is updated.

- The resolution pipeline no longer threads a key alongside the binding it
  belongs to. `resolve`, `await`, `materialise`, `construct`, `publish` and
  `startIfRunning` read `b.key`, and `resolver` no longer carries its own
  copy. The two could differ only on a `Bind` alias hop, where the node's key
  was the alias and the binding was its target.
- `lookup` returns the binding and its owning scope rather than a `found`
  struct, which had earned its name when it also reported the alias route and
  whether that route looped.
- Groups are keyed by `key` like the index, now that a key is a type and
  nothing else.
- The two top-level entry points that turn an internal abort into a plain
  error panic share one deferred `unwrapAbort` instead of a copy each.

### Testing

- `TestReview4ChildStopReportsItsOwnDrainFailure` no longer requires the root
  `Stop` to report a drain failure that a concurrent child `Stop` owned. It
  failed about one run in eight on `main`, so CI failed at about that rate
  too. Settling the failure into the child's phase is what releases the
  child's own `Stop`, which then finishes and detaches the child; if that
  beats the root's read of its child list, the root has nobody to inherit
  from. Both orders are correct -- the failure reaches the caller that owned
  that teardown, and `EventDrain` carries it to observers regardless -- so
  the assertion, not the container, was wrong. The test still pins what it
  was written for, that the child's own `Stop` reports it.
- `TestReview5RootStopReportsAChildsDrainFailure` is the half of that rule
  which does not depend on an interleaving: a `Stop` that owns a child's
  teardown reports a drain hook that failed in it. Mutation-tested by making
  the drain waiter drop the owner's error, which it catches.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-05

The API surface cut down ahead of the graph-validation work of
[#3](https://github.com/yandex/di/issues/3), so that it lands on a
smaller and more regular API, and the four defects of the fourth September
2026 review.

Nine identifiers are gone and one is renamed; `go doc -all` diffed against
0.6.0 lists exactly those and one addition, `Binding.Group`. An upgrade
breaks any caller that used one of them, and each entry under Removed and
Changed carries its one-line migration. Behaviour otherwise changes only in
the three ways listed under Fixed.

### Removed

- **`Binding.Named`, `Scope.Lookup`, `Key` and `di.Named`**, the one
  stringly-typed corner of the API. A second binding of one type is declared
  as a distinct type instead -- `type ReplicaDB struct{ *DB }` -- which the
  compiler checks at every reference, where a misspelt name was a missing key
  at runtime. The README described `.Named` as registering the key "also"
  under a name; it registered it under the name only.
- **`Scope.Add`.** Group membership is a property of a binding, like its
  lifetime, so it is now `Binding.Group`: `s.Add(ctor)` becomes
  `s.Provide(ctor).Group()`. `Value(v).Group()` adds a pre-built member,
  which `Add` could not express; `Bind` followed by `Group` is rejected at
  freeze, since an alias is never a group member.
- **`Scope.Middleware`** moved to the `dihttp` package as
  `dihttp.Middleware(s)`, with the usual `func(http.Handler) http.Handler`
  shape so a router's `Use` accepts it: `app.Middleware(mux)` becomes
  `dihttp.Middleware(app)(mux)`. The core package no longer imports net/http
  and no longer registers anything on a caller's behalf. `WithScope` and
  `FromContext` stay where they were.
- **`Scope.Bind`.** An interface is served by a constructor that returns the
  implementation: `s.Bind[Reader, *Repo]()` becomes
  `s.Provide(func(s *di.Scope) Reader { return s.Get[*Repo]() })`, declared
  `Scoped()` too when the target is. The closure is checked by the compiler
  where `Bind` checked `Implements` at registration, shares the target's
  instance because it returns the same pointer, and is an ordinary binding,
  so the alias machinery goes with it: the route marking for hops, the alias
  cycle detector and the eager-through-alias rules.
- **`Binding.Transient`.** A per-resolution value is a factory,
  `s.Provide(func(s *di.Scope) func() *X { ... })`, or a constructor called
  directly. Transient instances had no hooks and no tracking, which made
  them a lifetime in name only, and every teardown oracle carried an
  exemption for them.
- **`Binding.Health`, `Scope.HealthCheck`, `ErrUnhealthy` and
  `EventHealth`.** A health endpoint is a `Group` of checkers in user code;
  the README's "Health checks" section is now that recipe and
  `examples/app` uses it. What is lost is `HealthCheck` skipping services
  not yet built: `All` builds a checker's target instead, which is what an
  endpoint usually wants.
- **`Signals`.** `Run` exits on `os.Interrupt` and `SIGTERM`, which is what
  every caller used. `StopTimeout` stays as the one `RunOption`.
- **`SlogObserver`.** Four lines in user code, and the one place the package
  imported `log/slog`.

### Changed

- **`Binding.Run` is now `Binding.Worker`.** It shared a name with
  `Scope.Run`, the main-function helper, for an unrelated thing. Behaviour
  is unchanged; the error `Stop` returns for a hook that outlasts the
  deadline now reads "Worker hook did not return".

### Fixed

- `Scope.Run` reports a cause published through `Shutdown` while a failed
  `Start` was rolling back, not only one published during an ordinary stop. A
  rollback runs the drain and stop hooks, so a worker can die there exactly as
  it can during a shutdown; the error branch returned before the cause was
  ever read.
- A `Stop` reports the failure of a drain hook of its own scope even when an
  ancestor's `Stop` owned the phase and ran the hook. The waiter dropped the
  owner's error on the grounds that it reached the caller through the `Stop`
  that owned the drain -- true when that is the same call, and false for a
  request scope ending while the application shuts down, which is exactly
  where the failure needed reporting. Each scope's drain errors now settle
  into that scope's phase and reach the aggregate through its own `Stop`, so
  they are reported to every caller that should hear them and still appear
  once in any one error.
- A key cannot be overridden while a resolution of it is in flight. `used` is
  set only once a value has been served, so a constructor could register over
  its own key and resolve the replacement: the nested call was served the new
  value and the outer call returned the old one -- two live values for one
  key, from a single goroutine, past a guard meant to prevent exactly that.
  Re-registering after a *failed* resolution still works, which is how a key
  whose constructor failed is recovered.

Nine cuts to the API surface, made before the graph-validation work of
issue #3 so that it lands on a smaller and more regular API. Each one
breaks a caller that used the removed name, and each has a one-line
migration.

### Testing

The fourth review's findings were all in places the generators still could not
reach, so each fix comes with the shape that would have caught it:

- Drain hooks can fail now, and C11 holds a `Stop` to reporting the failure of
  a hook of its own scope. Every drain hook in the driver returned nil until
  now, so a scope that swallowed its own hook's failure looked exactly like
  one with nothing to report.
- The machines drive `Scope.Run`, with a context that is already cancelled so
  it starts and stops again. `Run` was the largest block of code only the
  hand-written tests reached, and it is where a worker's failure and a stop's
  errors are joined. Generator coverage: 82.5% to 88.5%.
- A registration shape whose constructor registers, and one that registers
  over its own key, so the registry being mutable during a resolution is
  something the generators exercise rather than something reviews find.
- `scripts/generatorgap.go` keyed coverage blocks by line number and merged
  the eighteen lines of `di.go` that carry more than one -- a hook registered
  and its body declared in a single expression -- so reaching the registration
  made the body look covered. It now keys on the full block, and CI checks its
  arithmetic against `go tool cover -func`, because a tool that measures a gap
  has to be measured itself.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-04

The six defects of the third September 2026 review, and then the question of
why three reviews in a row had each found about six. Measuring it gave a
number: the generators reached 78% of statements against the suite's 97%, and
the whole gap was the lifecycle -- no `Run` hook, no `Shutdown`, no context
expiring inside `Stop`, and every `Start` kept before every `Stop`. Every
defect all three reviews found lived in that gap. Most of this release is that
gap closed, in the tests and in the one place `di.go` had to change to make
closing it possible.

The public API is unchanged -- `go doc -all` is identical to 0.5.0's -- so
every change here is behaviour, and an upgrade can break a caller in the one
way listed under Changed.

### Changed

- **`Stop` is synchronous.** It now waits out whatever another goroutine is
  running for a service it is tearing down -- a start step in flight, a drain
  hook another `Stop` began -- so when it returns, the teardown has happened
  and its failures are in the error it returns rather than only in the event
  stream. A teardown outlives the call in one case now, when `Stop`'s own
  context expires first. Every review so far has reported the old asymmetry as
  a defect.

  The rule that buys it: **a lifecycle hook must not call `Stop` on its own
  scope or an ancestor** -- call `Shutdown`, which never blocks. That was
  already the documented contract, but `OnStart` was a working exception,
  since the mid-start teardown was handed to the goroutine running the step
  rather than waited for. It no longer is. Stopping a sibling scope, or one
  below the hook's own, is still allowed.

  A hook that passes on the context it was given now gets an error naming
  `Shutdown` instead of waiting: hook contexts carry the scope they belong to.
  A hook that calls `Stop` with a context of its own cannot be recognised, and
  waits until that context expires, so an unbounded one hangs where it used to
  work. This is the upgrade note: if a start hook stops its own scope, replace
  it with `Shutdown`.

### Fixed

- A drain hook may stop a scope that is neither its own nor an ancestor of it
  -- a sibling, or anything else outside its own line. The sweep used to claim
  the drain phase of every descendant before running a single hook, so such a
  `Stop` waited for a phase that only the walk it had just blocked could end:
  with a deadline it failed, with `context.Background` it hung. The sweep now
  claims a scope's phase immediately before it sweeps that scope, so the only
  phases held while a hook runs belong to the hook's own scope and its
  ancestors, which a hook may not stop anyway. Whether the old code deadlocked
  depended on the order the two scopes were created in.
- A `Stop` whose context runs out while another `Stop`'s `OnDrain` still holds
  an instance no longer drops that instance's `OnStop`. It had already taken
  the instance off its scope's list, so nothing else would ever reach it and
  the service was never released -- a second `Stop` replayed the stored error
  and released nothing either. The missed deadline is still reported, and the
  release now follows the drain hook's own return, exactly as it already did
  for a `Run` hook that outlasts the same deadline.
- `Scope.Run` reports a failure published through `Shutdown` while the stop was
  already running. `Run` read the cause once, before `Stop`, so a worker in a
  child scope that died after a cancelled context -- with its own scope stopped
  and detached by a hook that handled that error itself -- returned nothing to
  the caller. `Run` now re-reads the cause on the way out, and the existing
  de-duplication keeps a failure that arrived by both routes from being
  reported twice.
- A resolution made through the `*Scope` a finished constructor kept is no
  longer a false `ErrCycle` when a constructor *above* it is still building.
  0.5.0 stopped counting the finished frame itself; the frames above it were
  still counted, so `A` building, `B` returning and keeping its scope, and an
  independent resolution through that scope needing `A` was reported as a
  cycle -- and the verdict was cached, so the service stayed poisoned after
  `A` had long succeeded. A finished frame now ends the walk in both the path
  check and the wait-for graph.

  This is a trade, not a free fix, and it is the same one `Stop` makes for a
  start step in flight: without goroutine-local state there is no way to tell
  an independent late resolution from the constructor's own goroutine reaching
  back through an escaped scope into its own unfinished construction. The
  second now deadlocks where it used to be reported. It takes a service
  reaching into itself through a scope that escaped a nested constructor; the
  first is the documented pattern.
- A child scope created *inside* a constructor keeps that constructor's
  resolution, so a request through it that leads back to the service being
  built is reported as `ErrCycle`. `Child` used to hand back a scope with no
  path at all, which started a fresh resolution that then waited for the build
  it was part of: neither the path check nor the wait-for graph could connect
  the two halves. A child kept for later is unaffected -- its path is already
  finished, so it resolves as its own branch, and failures from it panic with
  a plain error as any top-level call does.
- A `Transient` constructor that finishes after its scope has stopped reports
  `ErrStopped` instead of handing the value back. Every other lifetime was
  re-checked after its wait; the transient branch returned without one, so a
  scope that had finished stopping could still serve a value it had no way to
  tear down.

### Testing

The gap above, closed in three pieces:

- The concurrent driver has all four of those now, and two new oracles: every
  instance that owes a stop step gets exactly one by quiescence, and a
  resolution begun after its scope's `Stop` returned fails. Generator coverage
  is 82.5%, and `scripts/generatorgap.go` prints what only the hand-written
  tests reach, which is the map of where the next review will dig. CI fails
  below 80%.
- The instance lifecycle has a model (`lifecyclemodel_test.go`). Registration
  is still checked against invariants rather than predictions, for the reason
  the tests have always given; what happens to an instance once it exists is a
  small documented state machine, and predicting it is what catches a hook
  that should have run and did not.
- The interleaving is an input (`scheduler_test.go`): hooks and operations
  park at scheduling points and a seed decides who goes next.

Each of these was mutation-tested rather than trusted. That is also how the
one defect in the *oracles* turned up: an exemption written for the ordering
oracle had switched off the drain/stop overlap check for exactly the shape it
exists for.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-04

Fixes for the six defects of the second September 2026 review, the `Run`-hook
overlap reported alongside them, two more that the tightened concurrent driver
found in those fixes, and the half of the first review's ninth defect that its
fix had left open. Almost all of it is the teardown path: draining, and how a
failure gets out of a worker.

The public API is unchanged -- `go doc -all` differs from 0.4.0 only in one
parameter name -- so every change is behaviour, and an upgrade can break a
caller in the two ways listed under Changed.

### Fixed

- The drain phase is now coherent with concurrent teardown, which is what the
  phase was added for in 0.4.0. Three defects shared that root cause: a `Stop`
  that reached a scope whose drain another `Stop` was running saw the flag,
  skipped the hook and went on to release what it was still using; a scope
  marked itself stopped while a descendant's drain was in flight, so those
  hooks lost the dependencies they were draining against; and a service or
  child scope first built *by* a drain hook was missed by the phase, so it was
  either stopped without being drained or drained after the parent had already
  stopped. Draining now runs once per scope with later arrivals waiting for
  it, and sweeps the scope until a pass finds no new work. The shape all three
  hit was an HTTP server finishing in-flight requests whose handlers take a
  request scope.
- A constructor may keep the `*Scope` it was handed -- which is how a
  goroutine it starts resolves later -- without a deferred resolution through
  it being reported as a false `ErrCycle`. A finished frame of the path is no
  longer treated as an active dependency. The false cycle was also recorded on
  whatever instance that resolution was building, so one such call poisoned
  that service for the life of the process.
- One `Bind` alias to a `Scoped` target is now a distinct edge in each scope
  that holds an instance of the target, as the target's own node already was.
  Keying the alias hop on the scope the alias was registered in collapsed
  those edges and reported an acyclic graph as `ErrCycle`.
- A scope that has stopped refuses to resolve, including a resolution that was
  already waiting on a constructor running in a live ancestor. Only the
  instance's holder was re-checked after the wait, so a fully stopped child
  could still be handed a value.
- A panicking `OnStart` is a failed start rather than a successful one. The
  instance was left looking started, so a caller that recovered the panic was
  served an initialisation that never finished, and `Stop` paired an `OnStop`
  with it. The panic now reaches `Resolve` as an error, like a panicking
  constructor, which also restores the rule that `Resolve` never panics.
- A drain hook that builds into a scope the phase has already swept no longer
  leaves that instance undrained. The sweep visited each descendant once,
  which was enough for a service first built in the scope doing the draining
  and not for one built a level along, so it could be stopped without ever
  being drained. Found by the drain oracle added to the concurrent driver
  after the review, not by the review.

  Two things come with that fix rather than being separate defects, because
  revisiting a scope is what makes them reachable at all. `Stop` waits for a
  drain hook per instance, not only through the scope-wide phase: that phase
  ends per scope -- it has to, or an outer scope draining an HTTP server would
  deadlock against a handler stopping its request scope -- so a sweep can be
  draining a late instance exactly as that scope's own `Stop` reaches it. And
  an instance whose scope has already stopped is not drained at all, since
  winding a service down for work it can no longer take on is the opposite of
  what `OnDrain` is for.
- `OnStop` no longer runs while a `Run` hook is still using the value. When a
  `Run` hook outlasts `Stop`'s context, `Stop` reports the missed deadline as
  before and the release now follows that hook's own return instead of racing
  it. Service code that only followed the lifecycle API could be reading
  what `OnStop` was closing.
- A `Run` hook's failure always reaches `Shutdown`. Whether it did used to
  depend on a race: the worker goroutine asked the run context whether *we*
  had cancelled it, and a `Stop` landing between two readings of that context
  flipped the verdict, so a worker that died of its own error could be written
  off as one we had stopped. Its failure then reached only the `Stop` that
  cancelled it, and a caller who discarded that -- or a child scope that had
  already detached -- left `Scope.Run` waiting for a signal that never came.
  This is the half of the September 2026 review's ninth defect that its fix
  left open, and it is why
  `TestReviewDetachedChildWorkerFailureReachesRun` could fail on timing alone.

### Testing

- The concurrent driver checks the drain phase instead of merely running it,
  and classifies the errors an operation may panic with rather than accepting
  any of them. Four of the six defects above were invisible to it: its drain
  hooks returned nil and touched nothing, and a false `ErrCycle` out of `Get`
  read as a legitimate failure. It also gained a registration shape that is
  both `Scoped` and draining, without which a drain-owing instance could
  never appear in a child scope, which is what made the seventh and eighth
  defects reachable.

  Two oracles were considered and rejected as unsound rather than added: that
  an instance owing a drain always gets one, and that a resolution inside a
  drain hook always succeeds. Both are true of a drain phase in isolation and
  false once a second `Stop` is tearing the same scope down, so both are
  pinned deterministically instead.

### Changed

- A `Run` hook that returns a non-nil error now calls `Shutdown` even when the
  scope was already stopping. Only `context.Canceled` from a hook we had
  cancelled is still treated as no failure at all. When an error surfaces says
  nothing about what caused it -- a worker may fail, flush what it has while
  the scope winds down, and only then report -- so the timing test that used to
  gate this was unsound in both directions. A caller who does not want a
  worker's shutdown-time error to take the application down should return nil
  from the hook: previously that error was silently confined to whichever
  `Stop` cancelled it.
- `Stop` can now be slower to return when a drain hook builds something: the
  phase keeps sweeping until nothing new appears, and both the sweep and the
  hooks are bounded by the context passed to `Stop`. A caller that passed a
  context without a deadline and relied on drain being a single pass will
  wait longer.

### Unchanged, deliberately

- A service whose start step is in flight when `Stop` runs is still torn down
  by the goroutine running that step, so that teardown can finish just after
  `Stop` returns and its error reaches observers rather than the caller. This
  looks like a defect and is a forced one: the goroutine running the step may
  be the caller of `Stop` itself, because a start hook is allowed to stop the
  scope, and Go offers no way to tell that case from another goroutine's start
  step. Waiting would deadlock exactly those callers. `Stop`'s documentation
  states the consequence; use `Shutdown` from a hook.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-04

Fixes for the eleven defects of the September 2026 review, plus the
resolution-during-`Start` gap it noted without counting. The public API gains
one method, `Binding.OnDrain`, and one `EventKind`, `EventDrain`; nothing was
removed or altered. Every other change is behaviour, and an upgrade can break
a caller in the three ways listed under Changed.

### Added

- `Binding.OnDrain` and the matching `EventDrain`. `Stop` now runs a drain
  phase before anything is torn down: `OnDrain` hooks run from the innermost
  scope outwards, in reverse build order, while every scope still resolves.
  It is where a service stops taking new work and waits for what it has. An
  HTTP server belongs here rather than in `OnStop`, because its handlers hold
  request scopes that `OnStop` would be racing.

### Fixed

- Concurrent `Stop` calls no longer break dependency order. A parent that
  finds a child already stopping now waits for that teardown to finish
  instead of seeing an emptied scope and closing what the child's hooks are
  still using. The shape this hit was an HTTP request ending as the
  application shut down.
- `Run` now applies its configured `StopTimeout`, and its signal handling, to
  the rollback of a failed `Start` as well as to an ordinary exit. A correct
  `OnStop` that waits on its context used to hang there forever.
- A constructor may resolve its dependencies from several goroutines. The
  resolution path is now an immutable linked list rather than a shared slice,
  which removes a data race and the false `ErrCycle` two parallel resolutions
  of one singleton could produce.
- A dependency cycle whose halves are built concurrently is reported as
  `ErrCycle` instead of deadlocking, through a wait-for graph between
  in-flight builds.
- A `Transient` constructor goes through the same wrapper as every other one:
  a panic inside it becomes an error rather than escaping `Resolve`, and a
  successful build emits `EventBuild`.
- Shadowing a key a scope has already been served is rejected along the whole
  lookup route, not just at its end. That covers a `Bind` alias owned by an
  outer scope, and any scope between the resolver and the owner of the
  binding; both could previously end up with two live values for one key.
- A nil interface can be registered and resolved. `Get`, `Lookup`, `Resolve`,
  `Maybe`, `All` and the hook adapters no longer panic on it.
- Cycle detection compares bindings rather than keys, so a group member and a
  plain registration of the same type are no longer treated as one node.
  `All` reported a false cycle for that pair.
- A worker that dies in a child scope reaches the root's `Run` even when the
  child is stopped and detached first. The failure is wrapped once and
  reported once, whether it arrives as the cause or as a `Stop` error.
- `Middleware` registers the same `*http.Request` it passes to the handler.
  A router writes path values and the matched pattern into the request it is
  given, so the copy registered before was missing everything the route
  matched, and its context carried no scope.

- A `Run` hook's failure always reaches `Shutdown`. Whether it did used to
  depend on a race: the worker goroutine asked the run context whether *we*
  had cancelled it, and a `Stop` landing between two readings of that context
  flipped the verdict, so a worker that died of its own error could be written
  off as one we had stopped. Its failure then reached only the `Stop` that
  cancelled it, and a caller who discarded that -- or a child scope that had
  already detached -- left `Scope.Run` waiting for a signal that never came.
  This is the half of the September 2026 review's ninth defect that its fix
  left open, and it is why
  `TestReviewDetachedChildWorkerFailureReachesRun` could fail on timing alone.

### Testing

- The concurrent driver checks the drain phase instead of merely running it,
  and classifies the errors an operation may panic with rather than accepting
  any of them. Four of the six defects above were invisible to it: its drain
  hooks returned nil and touched nothing, and a false `ErrCycle` out of `Get`
  read as a legitimate failure. It also gained a registration shape that is
  both `Scoped` and draining, without which a drain-owing instance could
  never appear in a child scope, which is what made the seventh and eighth
  defects reachable.

  Two oracles were considered and rejected as unsound rather than added: that
  an instance owing a drain always gets one, and that a resolution inside a
  drain hook always succeeds. Both are true of a drain phase in isolation and
  false once a second `Stop` is tearing the same scope down, so both are
  pinned deterministically instead.

### Changed

- Once a scope is running, a resolution waits for a start step another
  goroutine is running rather than returning the service unstarted. An
  `OnStart` hook must therefore not resolve a service that depends on the one
  being started, which would be a wait on itself.
- A hook must not call `Stop` on its own scope or an ancestor. Concurrent
  `Stop` calls now wait for the first, so that would be a wait on itself.
  Use `Shutdown`, which never blocks.
- A dying `Run` hook now records its error as the cause `Run` returns, as
  well as reporting it through `Stop`. `Run` recognises the two as one
  failure and reports it once.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

The public API is unchanged from 0.2.0: no signature was added, removed or
altered. Everything here is behaviour.

- A `Run` hook's failure always reaches `Shutdown`. Whether it did used to
  depend on a race: the worker goroutine asked the run context whether *we*
  had cancelled it, and a `Stop` landing between two readings of that context
  flipped the verdict, so a worker that died of its own error could be written
  off as one we had stopped. Its failure then reached only the `Stop` that
  cancelled it, and a caller who discarded that -- or a child scope that had
  already detached -- left `Scope.Run` waiting for a signal that never came.
  This is the half of the September 2026 review's ninth defect that its fix

  and classifies the errors an operation may panic with rather than accepting
  any of them. Four of the six defects above were invisible to it: its drain
  hooks returned nil and touched nothing, and a false `ErrCycle` out of `Get`

  drain hook always succeeds. Both are true of a drain phase in isolation and
  false once a second `Stop` is tearing the same scope down, so both are
  pinned deterministically instead.

### Changed

- Combinations that were silently ignored are now rejected when the
  registration batch is committed: lifecycle hooks or `Eager` on a
  `Transient` binding, `Eager` on a `Scoped` one, lifetimes or hooks on a
  `Bind` alias, and `Scoped` or `Transient` on a `Value`.
- Re-registering a key that has already served a value panics, including
  through an alias and in a scope that resolved the key from an outer
  scope. Overriding before the key is resolved is unchanged, so child
  scopes and `di.Test` are unaffected. A resolution that failed built
  nothing, so it leaves the key re-registerable.
- Group members registered with `Add` are ordinary bindings: built once,
  started and stopped like anything else. `All` no longer re-runs their
  constructors on every call.
- A stopped scope, and every scope under it, refuses to resolve with
  `ErrStopped`.
- `OnStop` runs only when it is owed: `OnStart` succeeded, or the binding
  has no `OnStart` to pair with, in which case `OnStop` is a plain
  destructor. A service built but never started is not torn down.
- `Bind` serves its target's own instance and lifetime, so aliasing a
  transient no longer caches it and aliasing a scoped one stays per scope.
  `Eager` may now be declared on an alias.
- `Transient` builds in the scope that resolves it, like `Scoped`.
- Eagerness belongs to the key, so it transfers to whichever binding owns
  it, and eager services build in registration order rather than map order.
- `Stop` may return just before a service whose start step was in flight
  finishes being torn down; that teardown reports to observers.

### Fixed

- A service built concurrently with `Start` could be started by neither
  path yet stopped anyway.
- `Start`'s rollback ran `OnStop` on services that never started, skipped
  child scopes, and abandoned live `Run` hooks when the caller's context
  was already cancelled.
- A `Run` hook that died on its own reported to nobody unless the scope was
  driven by `Scope.Run`.
- `Stop` called from inside a start hook deadlocked.
- A rejected registration batch was partly applied, so a retried `Start`
  silently succeeded with the invalid configuration dropped.
- `Maybe` reported an alias with a missing target as present, then failed
  inside `Get`; a looping alias chain had no cycle detection.
- An eager key served through an alias panicked with a nil dereference.
- One constructor panic permanently bricked its key, because the failed
  instance caches its error and re-registration was refused.

### Added

- A property test over random registration sequences, an operation-level
  model test checked against documented invariants rather than predicted
  values, and `FuzzMachine` over the same invariants, run in CI.
- Thirty-five regression tests, each verified to fail against the commit
  that preceded its fix.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- `di.Test`: a test scope wired from functions, stopped at cleanup, failing
  the test if a stop hook errors.
- Package overview documentation.

- A `Run` hook's failure always reaches `Shutdown`. Whether it did used to
  depend on a race: the worker goroutine asked the run context whether *we*
  had cancelled it, and a `Stop` landing between two readings of that context
  flipped the verdict, so a worker that died of its own error could be written
  off as one we had stopped. Its failure then reached only the `Stop` that
  cancelled it, and a caller who discarded that -- or a child scope that had
  already detached -- left `Scope.Run` waiting for a signal that never came.

- Transient bindings documented as untracked, so `OnStop`, `Run` and
  `Health` do not apply to them.
- CI uses golangci-lint-action v9.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-03

First tagged release of a Go 1.27 generic-method dependency injection
container: typed registration and resolution, child and request scopes,
`Scoped` and `Transient` lifetimes, groups, typed lifecycle hooks with
rollback and deterministic stop order, `Run` hooks for workers, health
checks, `Run` and `Shutdown` for graceful termination, and observability
events.
