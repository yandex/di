A dependency-injection container for Go 1.27+. Constructors are plain
functions, keys are Go types, and the container builds, starts and stops
services in dependency order.

```go
app := di.New()
app.Value(Config{DSN: "postgres://localhost/app"})
app.Wire[*DB](NewDB)     // func NewDB(Config) (*DB, error)
app.Wire[*Repo](NewRepo) // func NewRepo(*DB) *Repo

repo := app.Get[*Repo]() // builds Config, then DB, then Repo, each once
```

There is no code generation and no dependency outside the standard library.
`Wire` reads a constructor's signature once, with reflection, which is how
`Validate` can check the whole graph before a single constructor runs.
`Provide` takes a closure for the rare constructor that needs the scope
itself.

[**The guide**](https://yandex.github.io/di/) walks through one application
file by file. [**How it works**](docs/DESIGN.md) explains what happens between
`Get` and a value, with diagrams.

## Installation

```sh
go get golang.yandex/di
```

Requires Go 1.27 or newer. Editor support for generic methods needs gopls
v0.23 or newer.

## Quick start

[embedmd]:# (examples/quickstart/main.go go)
```go
// Quick start: register a few services, start and stop the application.
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"golang.yandex/di"
)

type Config struct{ DSN string }
type DB struct{ dsn string }
type Repo struct{ db *DB }
type Server struct{ repo *Repo }

// Plain constructors: their parameters are their dependencies.
func NewDB(cfg Config) *DB         { return &DB{dsn: cfg.DSN} }
func NewRepo(db *DB) *Repo         { return &Repo{db: db} }
func NewServer(repo *Repo) *Server { return &Server{repo: repo} }

func main() {
	app := di.New()

	app.Value(Config{DSN: "postgres://localhost/app"})

	app.Wire[*DB](NewDB).
		OnStop(func(ctx context.Context, db *DB) error { fmt.Println("db closed"); return nil })

	app.Wire[*Repo](NewRepo)

	app.Wire[*Server](NewServer).
		Eager().
		OnStart(func(ctx context.Context, srv *Server) error { fmt.Println("listening"); return nil }).
		OnStop(func(ctx context.Context, srv *Server) error { fmt.Println("server stopped"); return nil })

	ctx := context.Background()
	if err := app.Start(ctx); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer func() {
		if err := app.Stop(ctx); err != nil {
			log.Println(err)
		}
	}()

	fmt.Println("serving", app.Get[*Server]().repo.db.dsn)
}
```

## Guide

The sections follow the order an application comes together. Every
embedded example is a compiled program under [`examples/`](examples/), built
in CI.

### Registering and resolving

Each registration returns a `Binding[T]`. Its methods must be called before
the scope is first resolved.

| Call | Registers |
|---|---|
| `s.Provide(func(*di.Scope) T)` | A lazily built singleton. `T` is inferred. |
| `s.Wire[T](NewT)` | A lazily built singleton from a plain constructor. Its parameters are its dependencies; see [Validate](#validate). |
| `s.Wrap[T](fn)` | A wrapper over what serves `T`: `fn` takes that value first, then its dependencies; see [Wrapping a service](#wrapping-a-service). |
| `s.Value(v)` | An instance you already have. |
| `s.Use(mods...)` | What the modules register, attributed to them by name. |

| Method | Effect |
|---|---|
| `.Scoped()` | One instance per resolving scope, built and stopped there. |
| `.Group()` | A member of the group for `T`, read back with `s.All[T]()`. |
| `.Eager()` | Build during `Start`, in registration order. |
| `.Needs(...)` | How to fill a `Wire` parameter that is not a plain dependency: `di.AllOf[T]()` for a `[]T` holding the group, `di.Optional[T]()` for one that may go unprovided. |
| `.Override()` | Replace an earlier registration of `T` in this scope; a second one without it is rejected. |
| `.OnStart(f)`, `.OnStop(f)` | Lifecycle hooks, `f` is `func(context.Context, T) error`. |
| `.OnDrain(f)` | Runs before anything is stopped, while the scope still resolves. |
| `.Go(f)` | A worker: a long-running function in a goroutine of its own, cancelled on stop. |

To get a service back:

| Call | Returns |
|---|---|
| `s.Get[T]()` | `T`. Inside a constructor a failure unwinds to the caller; at top level it panics with the error. |
| `s.Resolve[T]()` | `(T, error)`. Never panics on a wiring problem. |
| `s.Maybe[T]()` | `(T, bool)`; see [Optional dependencies](#optional-dependencies). |
| `s.All[T]()` | Every member of the group for `T`, across the scope chain. |
| `s.Must(v, err)` | `v`, or aborts the constructor with `err`. |
| `s.Context()` | The context passed to `Start`, so constructors can dial with a deadline. |

Errors wrap `di.ErrNotProvided`, `di.ErrCycle` or `di.ErrStopped`:

```
di: building *app.Repo (provided at app/wire.go:31): *app.DB: not provided (needed by [*app.Repo])
di: building *app.A (provided at ...): di: building *app.B (provided at ...): di: dependency cycle: [*app.A *app.B] -> *app.A
```

`Provide` takes a closure that pulls its dependencies with `s.Get`. `Wire`
takes a plain constructor, `func(A, B) T` or `func(A, B) (T, error)`; its
parameters are its dependencies, so `Validate` can check them before
anything runs, and a wrong shape is rejected at registration. A slice
parameter is a key rather than a group unless `Needs(di.AllOf[T]())` says
otherwise. A constructor that needs the scope itself stays a closure.

An interface is served by a constructor that returns the implementation:

```go
app.Provide(func(s *di.Scope) Reader { return s.Get[*Repo]() })
app.Wire[Reader](NewRepo) // the same, when NewRepo returns *Repo
```

Both keys share one instance. Mark it `Scoped()` too when the target is.
`Wire` accepts any result assignable to the key.

Three rules, checked when the scope is next resolved:

- A second registration of a key in one scope must say `Override()`, or it
  is rejected naming both sites; so is an `Override()` with nothing to
  override. It inherits the key's eagerness. A child shadows its parent's
  key without the marker.
- A key that has served a value cannot be replaced, in its own scope or in
  any scope that resolved through it.
- `Eager` on a `Scoped` binding, and `Scoped` on a `Value`, are rejected.

#### Optional dependencies

A dependency nothing provides is an error unless the registration says
otherwise. `Needs` says so, and the constructor stays a function anyone can
call:

```go
// func NewReport(s *Store, t *Tracer) *Report
app.Wire[*Report](NewReport).Needs(di.Optional[*Tracer]())
```

`*Tracer` is passed if anything provides it and nil if nothing does. The
marker is on the registration rather than on the parameter, so it is fx's
`optional:"true"` without a struct tag — and because it is declared,
`Validate` checks the rest of that constructor, `Explain` draws the
parameter as `not provided, optional`, and `Modules` lists it.

Two alternatives are often better than optionality at all:

```go
app.Value[*Cache](nil)           // a nil default: provided, checked, overridden where there is one
app.Wire[Metrics](NewNopMetrics) // a null object: nothing downstream has a branch
```

`Scope.Maybe` asks the same question from inside a closure, for a key
nothing registers at all. It is the escape hatch: a closure declares
nothing, so `Validate` lists it as unchecked.

Whether a key is provided is a question about the chain as it stands — a
child scope may answer it differently — so registering it later is never
rejected, and asking then providing a default works:

```go
if _, ok := app.Maybe[*Cache](); !ok {
    app.Value(newCache())
}
```

A service built before the key was registered keeps the answer it got,
though, and `Explain` names it, which is where a dependency wired too late
shows up:

```
*app.Tracer: value in root, not built (provided at tracing.go:8)
missed by: *app.Router in root
```

### Lifecycle

`Start` builds every `Eager` binding, then runs `OnStart` hooks in build
order. If one fails, `Start` stops what had started, child scopes included,
and returns both errors. A service built after `Start` runs its `OnStart` as
it is built.

`Stop` drains, stops the child scopes, then runs `OnStop` hooks in reverse
build order, and joins every failure into its error. `OnStop` runs when
`OnStart` succeeded or when there is none. After `Stop`, the scope and
everything under it resolves with `di.ErrStopped`.

`Stop` is safe to call twice or concurrently: later calls wait for the first
and report its result. So a hook must not call `Stop` on its own scope or an
ancestor; it calls `Shutdown`, which never blocks.

`OnStart` returns when the service is ready. A server binds its listener in
the hook, so a busy port fails `Start`, and serves in a goroutine.

A binding carries one hook of each kind. A second `OnStart`, `OnDrain`,
`OnStop` or `Go` is rejected, naming the registration and the second call,
rather than replacing the first: put the whole step in one function, where
its order is yours.

#### Draining

`OnDrain` runs before anything is stopped, innermost scope first, while
every scope still resolves. It is where a service stops taking work and
finishes what it has.

```go
app.Wire[*http.Server](newServer).Eager().
    OnDrain(func(ctx context.Context, srv *http.Server) error { return srv.Shutdown(ctx) }).
    OnStop(func(ctx context.Context, srv *http.Server) error { return srv.Close() })
```

An HTTP server's handlers hold request scopes, and shutting it down from
`OnStop` would race their teardown. Draining first keeps them alive until
the handlers return.

#### Workers

`Go` registers a worker: a function that loops until told to stop, in a
goroutine of its own. It is errgroup's `Go`, applied to a service.

```go
app.Wire[*Mailer](newMailer).Eager().Go(func(ctx context.Context, m *Mailer) error {
    return m.Loop(ctx) // returns when ctx is cancelled
})
```

The context is cancelled when the service stops, and `Stop` waits for the
function within its deadline. A worker that returns an error calls
`Shutdown`; `context.Canceled` after cancellation means nothing.

A worker starts as soon as its own service has, while services after it may
still be starting. `Ready` is closed once the whole `Start` succeeds and
never if it fails, so a server binds in `OnStart` and serves from its worker
only after `Ready`, selecting on its context too: a failed start then rolls
back without a request served. A scope's `Ready` follows the nearest `Start`
at or above it, as `Context` does. `dihttp.Serve` does all of this for an
`*http.Server`.

#### Run and Shutdown

`Run` is the helper for `main`: start, block until the context is cancelled,
`SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` arrives, or `Shutdown` is called, then stop with a
bounded context. A second signal cancels that context.

Both phases are bounded, 15 seconds each by default. `StartTimeout` expires
the context the `OnStart` hooks receive and ends the start between steps, so
a hook waiting on something that never arrives fails and rolls back instead
of hanging the process; `StartTimeout(0)` takes the bound off.

It bounds that phase and no more. A constructor reads `Scope.Context`, which
is the context `Run` was called with, and a worker runs for as long as its
service. A service resolved from *inside* a start hook is started there and
then, on the scope's context, so a hook that waits on such a service is not
bounded either — the deadline is checked between the steps `Start` drives.

### Scopes

A child scope resolves through its parent, shares its singletons, and owns
what it builds itself.

[embedmd]:# (examples/scopes/main.go go)
```go
// Scopes: a child scope sees everything in its parent and can shadow it.
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"golang.yandex/di"
)

type DB struct{ dsn string }
type User struct{ Name string }
type Handler struct {
	db   *DB
	user *User
}

func NewHandler(db *DB, user *User) *Handler { return &Handler{db: db, user: user} }

func main() {
	app := di.New()
	app.Wire[*DB](func() *DB { return &DB{dsn: "postgres://localhost/app"} })

	// One child per request: request-scoped values live here, shared
	// singletons such as *DB are reused from app.
	req := app.Child("request")
	req.Value(&User{Name: "ada"})
	req.Wire[*Handler](NewHandler)

	h := req.Get[*Handler]()
	fmt.Println(h.user.Name, "->", h.db.dsn)
	fmt.Println("same db:", h.db == app.Get[*DB]())
}
```

A singleton is built in the scope that registered it. A service that has
to see a child's values is `Scoped()`: one instance per resolving scope,
built there.

#### Request scopes

`dihttp.Middleware` gives each request a child scope holding the
`*http.Request`, puts it in the request context, and stops it when the
handler returns. It has the `func(http.Handler) http.Handler` shape.
`dihttp.Module` registers one:

```go
import "golang.yandex/di/dihttp"

app.Use(dihttp.Module, api.Module)

func NewServer(cfg Config, mw dihttp.Middleware) *http.Server {
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.Handle("GET /users/{id}", dihttp.Handle((*Users).Show))
    mux.Handle("GET /healthz", dihttp.Handle((*Health).Check))
    return &http.Server{Addr: cfg.Addr, Handler: mw(mux)}
}
```

`dihttp.Serve(app.Wire[*http.Server](NewServer))` gives that server its
lifecycle: it is eager, binds in `OnStart` so a busy port fails the start,
serves once the whole start has succeeded, drains in `OnDrain` and closes in
`OnStop`. A port of 0 in `Addr` is replaced with the one chosen.
`examples/server` below writes the same hooks by hand.

`dihttp.Handle` resolves a handler type from the request's scope and calls
the method; mark the type `Scoped()` when it needs the request.
`dihttp.HandleFunc` is the same as an `http.HandlerFunc`, for a router such as
chi whose `Get` and `Post` take one. Services
that depend on the request are declared once, in the root, as `Scoped()`:

```go
app.Wire[*User](func(r *http.Request) *User { return &User{Name: r.Header.Get("X-User")} }).Scoped()
```

For a server the container does not build, `dihttp.NewMiddleware(app)`
makes the middleware outside it and `di.FromContext` reaches the scope by
hand:

```go
mux.HandleFunc("GET /hello", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    req, _ := di.FromContext(r.Context()) // the request scope the middleware opened
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "hello", req.Get[*User]().Name)
})
srv := &http.Server{Handler: dihttp.NewMiddleware(app)(mux)}
```

For gRPC, [`digrpc`](digrpc) is the same adapter as a separate module, so
the library itself does not depend on grpc: `go get golang.yandex/di/digrpc`.
Its `Interceptor` opens a scope per call holding a `*digrpc.Call`, the method
and the incoming context, and `Module` provides it. `digrpc.Register[*Users](srv, &pb.Users_ServiceDesc)`
serves a generated service with an implementation resolved from that scope,
so the implementation is a service like a handler type under `dihttp.Handle`:
`Scoped()` when it takes the call, built after the interceptors have run, and
a constructor's status error is the call's. `digrpc.Serve(b, listen)` runs
the server as `dihttp.Serve` does, on the listener `listen` returns, with
`GracefulStop` as the drain hook.

	}
}
```

</details>

`di.WithScope` and `di.FromContext` are the primitives without `net/http`.

#### Values that change

There is no transient lifetime. A value made fresh on every use is a
function, registered and resolved like any service. Its type is the key, so
it is named:

```go
type NewID func(n int) string

app.Wire[NewID](func(cfg Config) NewID {
    return func(n int) string { return fmt.Sprintf("%s-%d", cfg.Prefix, n) }
})
```

The container builds the factory once and never sees what it makes. A value
that needs a lifecycle of its own is `Scoped()` and resolved from a child
opened for one unit of work, which stops it.

A value that changes while the application runs, such as reloaded
configuration, is held by a service that does not. A lifetime would not
help: a singleton's constructor is called once and captures one snapshot
regardless.

```

A long-lived service takes the source and reads `Current()` when it needs
the value. A per-request service takes `Config`: a `Scoped()` snapshot
wired from the source, built once per request scope. Resolve it from
request scopes; one resolved from the application scope is cached there. A
service that must react to a change subscribes to the source.

#### Groups

`Group()` makes a registration a member of the group for its type, and
`All` resolves every member across the scope chain. The usual case is a
health endpoint:

```go
type Checker interface{ Check(ctx context.Context) error }

app.Wire[Checker](func(db *DB) Checker { return db }).Group()

mux.HandleFunc("GET /healthz", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    for _, c := range app.All[Checker]() {
        if err := c.Check(r.Context()); err != nil {
            http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusServiceUnavailable)
            return
        }
    }
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "ok")
})
```

`All` builds members not built yet. Members keep their own lifetimes and
hooks. A plain registration of the same type is neither shadowed by the
group nor part of it.

A constructor takes the group as a plain slice, and `Needs` says which
parameter it is:

```go
// func NewRouter(rs []Route) *Router
app.Wire[*Router](NewRouter).Needs(di.AllOf[Route]())
```

That is `All[Route]()` called where the constructor runs, so a `Scoped`
consumer sees the members its own scope adds, and an empty group is the nil
slice rather than an error. The dependency stays declared, so `Validate`
walks every member and `Explain` draws them.

Membership is read when you ask, so a group may grow and adding a member is
never rejected. A value already built from the group keeps the members it
got, though, and `Explain` says so, as it does for an optional key wired
late — which is the answer to why a member that looks registered is not
serving:

```
app.Route: singleton group member in root, not built (provided at routes.go:44)
missed by: *app.Router in root
```

#### More than one instance of a type

A key is a Go type, so two live instances of one type need two types. While
the set is fixed, a defined type names each one and embedding keeps the
methods: `type Primary struct{ *DB }`. The surrogate appears in constructor
signatures and nowhere else; `Wire` resolves it like any parameter, and
`Validate` and `Explain` see two services.

<details>

[embedmd]:# (examples/instances/main.go go)

// More than one instance of a type: while the set is fixed, a defined type
// names each one.
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"golang.yandex/di"

type DB struct{ dsn string }

func (d *DB) Query() string { return "query " + d.dsn }

// One defined type per instance. Embedding promotes the methods, so only the
// constructor below mentions the surrogate.
type Primary struct{ *DB }
type Replica struct{ *DB }

type Repo struct{ read, write *DB }

func NewRepo(p Primary, r Replica) *Repo { return &Repo{write: p.DB, read: r.DB} }

func main() {
	app := di.New()

	// Two databases, told apart by type. Each keeps its own hooks.
	app.Value(Primary{&DB{dsn: "primary"}}).
		OnStop(func(context.Context, Primary) error { fmt.Println("primary closed"); return nil })
	app.Value(Replica{&DB{dsn: "replica"}}).
		OnStop(func(context.Context, Replica) error { fmt.Println("replica closed"); return nil })
	app.Wire[*Repo](NewRepo)

	repo := app.Get[*Repo]()
	fmt.Println("writes:", repo.write.Query())
	fmt.Println("reads: ", repo.read.Query())

	_ = app.Stop(context.Background())
}
```

</details>

When the set comes from configuration, register the instances as a group,
fold them into a registry, and let the resolving scope pick: the selector is
a constructor whose parameter is the key, marked `Scoped()`.

<details>
<summary><code>examples/shards/main.go</code>, configured shards picked by a scoped selector</summary>

[embedmd]:# (examples/shards/main.go go)
```go
// A configured set of instances: the members are not known until the config
// is read, so no type can name them. They are registered as a group, folded
// into a registry, and picked by a value the resolving scope provides. Every
// constructor here is plain, so the whole graph is checked before anything
// is built: nothing is unchecked and only the shard name is owed.
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"golang.yandex/di"
)

type DB struct{ dsn string }

func (d *DB) Query() string { return "query " + d.dsn }

type Config struct{ Shards []string }

type Shard struct {
	Name string
	DB   *DB
}

type Shards map[string]*DB

type ShardName string

func selectShard(want ShardName, all Shards) (*DB, error) {
	db, ok := all[string(want)]
	if !ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("no shard %q", want)
	}
	return db, nil
}

// The fold is an ordinary constructor too: its parameter is the group, which
// Needs says at the registration rather than here.
func shardRegistry(all []Shard) Shards {
	m := Shards{}
	for _, sh := range all {
		m[sh.Name] = sh.DB
	}
	return m
}

func main() {
	cfg := Config{Shards: []string{"eu-1", "us-1"}}

	app := di.New()
	app.Value(cfg)

	// One binding per configured shard, read back together as a registry.
	for _, name := range cfg.Shards {
		app.Value(Shard{Name: name, DB: &DB{dsn: name}}).Group()
	}
	app.Wire[Shards](shardRegistry).Needs(di.AllOf[Shard]())

	// The selector is an ordinary constructor: its ShardName parameter is the
	// key, and Scoped() leaves the choice to the scope that resolves it.
	app.Wire[*DB](selectShard).Scoped()

	for _, tenant := range cfg.Shards {
		req := app.Child(tenant)
		req.Value(ShardName(tenant))
		fmt.Println(tenant, "->", req.Get[*DB]().Query())
		_ = req.Stop(context.Background())
	}

	// The root does not provide ShardName, so Validate reports it as owed by
	// whichever scope resolves the shard rather than as a failure.
	fmt.Println("owed:", app.Validate().Owed)

	_ = app.Stop(context.Background())
}
```

</details>

Rules and traps:

- Use `Wire` for the selector. Its parameter declares the key, so `Validate`
  reports it in `Owed` and `Validate(di.Provided[T]())` discharges it. A
  `Provide` closure declares nothing, so the missing key is found by the
  first request.
- One key resolves to one value per scope. Two shards at once means the
  registry, or a scope each.
- A type alias is not a new key: `type CacheDB = *DB` is the same
  `reflect.Type`. A surrogate is a defined type.
- A surrogate that embeds an interface satisfies it but is still a separate
  key: registering `Cold` does not serve `Store`.

### Composing modules

A module is a function that registers into a scope. `Use` applies modules
in order and records which made each registration:

```go
func Storage(s *di.Scope) {
    s.Wire[*DB](NewDB)     // func NewDB(Config) (*DB, error)
    s.Wire[*Repo](NewRepo) // func NewRepo(*DB) *Repo
}

func Caching(s *di.Scope) {
    s.Wire[*Cache](NewCache) // func NewCache(*Repo) *Cache
}

app := di.New()
app.Value(Config{DSN: dsn})
app.Use(Storage, Caching)

cache := app.Get[*Cache]() // Config, then *DB, then *Repo, then *Cache
```

A module may depend on what a later one provides, since nothing is built
until it is asked for. What the order does decide is the build order of
`Eager` bindings, the order `All` returns a group in, and what a `Wrap` or
an `Override()` finds to act on.

The attribution is what makes a mistake legible. Two modules registering one
key is a mistake rather than last-wins:

```go
func Caching(s *di.Scope) {
    s.Wire[*DB](NewCacheDB) // a second *DB
    s.Wire[*Cache](NewCache)
}

app.Use(Storage, Caching)
app.Get[*Repo]()
// di: *app.DB is provided at app.Storage (storage.go:12) and again at
// app.Caching (caching.go:8): a second registration of a key must be marked
// Override() to replace the first
```

Without that rule the second `*DB` would silently rewire `Storage`'s
`*Repo`. Two modules that each need their own `*DB` declare distinct types;
a module that means to replace another's registration says `Override()`.

Keys are types, so an unexported type can be named, and so resolved,
overridden or wrapped, only by its own package. That is the privacy model: a
module exports its contract and its `Module` function.

```go
type db struct{ dsn string }               // only this package can say Get[*db]()

func Module(s *di.Scope) {
    s.Wire[*db](newDB).OnStop(func(_ context.Context, db *db) error { return db.Close() })
    s.Wire[Store](newPGStore)                  // the exported contract
}
```

`Explain`, `Graph` and `Validate` still see private services. A test
overrides what is exported. [`examples/guide`](examples/guide) is an
application wired this way, one module per package.

#### Wrapping a service

`Wrap[T]` composes over whatever serves `T` when it is called: the latest
registration in this scope, or an ancestor's. The function takes the wrapped
value first, then its dependencies, and returns `T` or `(T, error)`. The
wrapped registration keeps its hooks and lifetime, is built first and
stopped after. Wrappers chain in registration order. uber/fx calls this
`Decorate`.

<details>
<summary><code>examples/wrap/main.go</code>, the program that prints the output below</summary>

[embedmd]:# (examples/wrap/main.go go)
```go
// Wrap: compose over a service without replacing it. The wrapped
// registration keeps its hooks and lifetime, and a wrapper in a child scope
// applies to that scope alone.
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"golang.yandex/di"
)

type Store interface{ Get(key string) string }

type PGStore struct{}
type Cache struct{ hits int }
type CachingStore struct {
	next  Store
	cache *Cache
}
type TracingStore struct{ next Store }

func (*PGStore) Get(key string) string        { return "row " + key }
func (c *CachingStore) Get(key string) string { c.cache.hits++; return c.next.Get(key) }
func (t *TracingStore) Get(key string) string { return "traced(" + t.next.Get(key) + ")" }

func NewPGStore() *PGStore                       { return &PGStore{} }
func NewCachingStore(next Store, c *Cache) Store { return &CachingStore{next: next, cache: c} }
func NewTracingStore(next Store) Store           { return &TracingStore{next: next} }

func main() {
	app := di.New()

	app.Wire[Store](NewPGStore).
		OnStop(func(context.Context, Store) error { fmt.Println("pg closed"); return nil })

	// The first parameter is the value being wrapped; the rest are
	// dependencies. The store keeps its OnStop, and is stopped after the
	// wrapper, since it was built first.
	app.Wrap[Store](NewCachingStore)

	// A wrapper in a child scope wraps the parent's value for that scope and
	// its descendants; the parent and its other children are untouched.
	debug := app.Child("debug")
	debug.Wrap[Store](NewTracingStore)

	fmt.Println("app:  ", app.Get[Store]().Get("1"))
	fmt.Println("debug:", debug.Get[Store]().Get("1"))

	// Both paths went through the one caching wrapper, which is the *Cache
	// the child's tracing wrapper composes over rather than a second one.
	fmt.Println("hits: ", app.Get[*Cache]().hits)
	fmt.Print(app.Explain[Store]())
	_ = app.Stop(context.Background())
}
```

</details>

```
app:   row 1
debug: traced(row 1)
hits:  2
main.Store: singleton wrapper in root, built (provided at main.go:40)
├── main.Store: singleton in root, built (provided at main.go:34)
└── *main.Cache: value in root, built (provided at main.go:33)
needed by: main.Store in debug
pg closed
```

Three rules:

- A wrapper takes the lifetime of what it wraps; `Scoped()` on the wrapper
  puts one per scope around a shared singleton.
- A wrapper in a child scope applies to that child and its descendants.
- `Override()` after a wrapper replaces the whole chain, and a wrapped
  registration cannot be overridden while the wrapper stands. Nothing to
  wrap, a group, and a key already resolved are rejected.

#### Testing

`di.Test` wires the production graph into a fresh scope, stops it when the
test ends, and fails the test if a stop hook errors. Override what you need
before anything is resolved, and mark it `Override()`.

[embedmd]:# (examples/testing/repo_test.go go)
```go
package app

import (
	"testing"

	"golang.yandex/di"
)

func TestRepo(t *testing.T) {
	s := di.Test(t, Production)                     // production graph, stopped when the test ends
	s.Value(&DB{DSN: "sqlite://memory"}).Override() // replaces the production *DB, and says so

	repo := s.Get[*Repo]() // built against the fake DB
	if repo.DB.DSN != "sqlite://memory" {
		t.Fatalf("got %q", repo.DB.DSN)
	}
}
```

### Checking and inspecting

#### Validate

A wired constructor's dependencies are known at registration, so the graph
can be checked with nothing built. `Validate` reports what would fail: a
missing dependency, a cycle, or a singleton that would build a
request-scoped service in the wrong scope. `Provide` closures are listed as
unchecked.

| Call | Returns |
|---|---|
| `s.Validate()` | A `Validation`. `Err()` joins `Errors`, the failures the declared graph proves. `Owed` lists what a `Scoped` binding needs that this scope does not provide, left to the scope that resolves it. `Unchecked` lists the `Provide` closures. |
| `s.Validate(di.Provided[T]()...)` | The same check as the resolving scope would make it, told that it holds a `T`. With stubs nothing is owed: what neither the scope nor the stubs provide is an error. |

A `Scoped` binding is checked as the calling scope would resolve it, so what
that scope does not provide is owed rather than wrong. Call `Validate` from
the scope that will provide it, or say what it holds with
`di.Provided[T]()`.

#### Explain, Graph and Modules

Three renderers: `Explain` for one service, `Graph` for everything built,
`Modules` for what each module provides and needs. What was built has a
recorded graph; what was wired has a declared one.

`Explain[T]` prints one service's dependency tree with lifetime, scope,
phase and registration site, then what needed it:

```
*main.Server: singleton in root, eager, started (provided at main.go:36)
├── *main.Repo: singleton in root, started (provided at main.go:34)
│   └── *main.DB: singleton in root, started (provided at main.go:33)
│       └── main.Config: value in root, started (provided at main.go:32)
└── *main.Cache: singleton in root, started (provided at main.go:35)
    └── *main.DB: see above

*main.DB: singleton in root, started (provided at main.go:33)
└── main.Config: value in root, started (provided at main.go:32)
needed by: *main.Repo in root, *main.Cache in root
```

A dependency reached twice is expanded once.

`Graph` renders everything built in a scope and its descendants as Graphviz
DOT, one cluster per scope:

```sh
go run ./examples/explain | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
```

`Modules` reports what each module provides, needs and wraps, and which
module serves each need. The guide application's report, before anything is
built:

[embedmd]:# (examples/guide/testdata/modules.txt)
```txt
registered directly
  provides   *slog.Logger
config.Module
  provides   config.Config
storage.Module
  provides   *storage.db, storage.Store
  needs      config.Config ← config.Module
cache.Module
  provides   *cache.cache
  wraps      storage.Store ← storage.Module
mail.Module
  provides   *mail.Mailer
  needs      *slog.Logger ← registered directly
dihttp.Module
  provides   dihttp.Middleware
  unchecked  dihttp.Middleware (closures: needs known when they run)
api.Module
  provides   *api.caller, *api.users, *api.health, *http.Server
  needs      *http.Request ← owed to a resolving scope
             storage.Store ← cache.Module
             *mail.Mailer ← mail.Module
             config.Config ← config.Module
             dihttp.Middleware ← dihttp.Module
```

None of the three builds anything: an unbuilt wired service shows its
declared dependencies dashed, as under `Validate`, and a closure that has
not run ends its branch.

#### Observability

```go
app.Observe(func(ev di.Event) {
    if ev.Kind == di.EventBuild {
        buildDuration.WithLabelValues(ev.Service).Observe(ev.Duration.Seconds())
    }
})
```

Observers receive an `Event` for every constructor and hook in the scope
and its descendants, and one per `Shutdown`: service, package, scope,
module, site, duration and error. [`dislog`](dislog/) is that function
written against `log/slog`:

```go
app.Observe(dislog.New(slog.Default()))
```

A failed step is logged at `slog.LevelError` with the site, anything else
at `slog.LevelInfo` or the level `dislog.Level` sets; `dislog.Site()` logs
the site every time.

Observers see the scope they are registered on and everything under it.
Events arrive on the goroutine that did the work, so a slow handler slows
the application.

## Performance

[`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/) is a separate module comparing this package with
[samber/do](https://github.com/samber/do) and
[uber-go/dig](https://github.com/uber-go/dig) on the same four-service graph,
so the library itself stays dependency-free. On an Apple M3 Max:

| | Warm resolve | Cold register and build |
|---|---|---|
| `di`, `Provide` closure | 21 ns, 0 B, 0 allocs | 4.0 µs, 4.4 kB, 68 allocs |
| `di`, `Wire` | 21 ns, 0 B, 0 allocs | 5.1 µs, 5.4 kB, 86 allocs |
| `do` v2.1 | 134 ns, 160 B, 6 allocs | 7.0 µs, 11.2 kB, 120 allocs |
| `dig` v1.19 | 486 ns, 768 B, 24 allocs | 19.9 µs, 24.3 kB, 302 allocs |

`di` is measured twice because `dig.Provide` is reflective like `Wire`
rather than like a closure; the warm figures are the same, and the cold
difference is the signature read and `reflect.Call`.

**The `dig` warm figure needs a caveat.** dig has no typed accessor, so the
nearest thing to a resolve is `Invoke` with a function dig reflects over on
every call, and an fx application invokes once at startup. The cold
comparison is the fair one; read the warm number as what dig costs on a
request path, which it does not set out to serve.

```sh
cd benchmarks && go test -bench . -benchmem
```

## Versioning

While the major version is 0, a minor bump may change behaviour. Every entry
in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and on the
[releases page](https://github.com/yandex/di/releases) says whether an
upgrade can break a caller.

## Contributing

External contributions need a one-time CLA declaration on the pull request;
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the sentence and the link. The pull
request template lists the rest.

There is one regression test per historical defect, and generative suites
for the parts that proved easiest to get wrong: a property test over random
registration sequences, a model-based test over random operation sequences
checked against documented invariants and a lifecycle model, the same
operations run in parallel lanes under the race detector, and fuzz targets
over both.

```sh
go test -race ./...
go test -run '^$' -fuzz 'FuzzMachine$' -fuzztime 2m .
go test -race -run '^$' -fuzz FuzzMachineConcurrent -fuzztime 2m .
```
