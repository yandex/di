package di_test

// A concurrent driver over the same operations as machine_test.go, plus the
// oracles that only mean anything when calls overlap. Outcomes are not
// predicted; what is checked is:
//
//	C1  No operation panics except with a configuration rejection, or with
//	    one of the errors the package documents.
//	C2  Every operation returns: each lane is bounded and the run has a
//	    deadline.
//	C3  Stop respects scope order: no stop hook of a scope may begin while a
//	    stop hook of one of its descendants is still running.
//	C4  Nothing is stopped more often than it was built.
//	C5  A service is built once however many resolutions race for it.
//	C6  No stop hook of an instance begins while that instance's own drain
//	    hook is still running. Drain hooks build into a scope under the one
//	    being drained, which puts a late instance where a sweep above it may
//	    still reach it as its own Stop arrives.
//	C7  Drain hooks resolve, so the phase runs against a live registry. That
//	    the resolution succeeds is not asserted: a Stop of the hook's own
//	    scope from another lane may legitimately stop it mid-hook, and the
//	    deterministic tests know the phase boundary instead.
//	C8  One fixed graph, one verdict: two resolutions of the same key from
//	    the same scope never disagree about a cycle or a missing provider.
//	C9  Every instance that owes a stop step gets exactly one, once
//	    everything has gone quiet. This sees a release dropped on a path
//	    nobody returns from, which C4, counting only excess stops, cannot.
//	C10 A resolution begun after its scope's Stop has returned fails. Begun,
//	    not finished: one already in flight may return a value decided
//	    before the scope stopped.
//	C11 A Stop reports the failure of a drain hook of its own scope, whether
//	    it ran that hook or waited for another Stop that owned the phase.
//	C12 A Ready seen closed has a Start at or above its scope that returned
//	    nil, or a Run there, whose error cannot say whether its start did.
//	    And the other way, on the root: once its Start or Run returned nil,
//	    the channel Ready gave before anything ran is closed.
