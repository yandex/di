// Package di is a dependency-injection container for Go 1.27+ built on
// generic methods.
//
// Services are registered on a [Scope] and resolved from it by type. A
// constructor is a plain function, and its parameters are its dependencies:
//
//	app := di.New()
//	app.Value(Config{DSN: "postgres://localhost/app"})
//	app.Wire[*DB](NewDB). // func NewDB(Config) (*DB, error)
//		OnStop(func(ctx context.Context, db *DB) error { return db.Close() })
//	app.Wire[*Repo](NewRepo) // func NewRepo(*DB) *Repo
//
//	repo, err := app.Resolve[*Repo]()
//
// Keys are Go types, so there is no naming scheme and no collisions between
// packages. [Scope.Wire] reads a constructor's signature once, at
// registration, so the graph is declared before anything is built:
// [Scope.Validate] checks every declared dependency without running a
// constructor, and a constructor that returns an error fails the enclosing
// [Scope.Resolve], [Scope.Start] or [Scope.Run] with the dependency path and
// the registration site.
//
// [Scope.Provide] takes a closure over the scope instead, for the rare
// constructor that needs the scope itself, such as middleware that opens a
// child scope per request. Inside it, [Scope.Get] and [Scope.Must] pull
// dependencies and abort on failure, with the same error. A closure's
// dependencies are known only once it runs, so Validate and [Scope.Modules]
// list it as unchecked, and [Scope.Explain] can show what it needed only
// after it has been built.
//
// # Lifetimes
//
// A binding is a singleton by default, cached in the scope that registered
// it. [Binding.Scoped] makes it one instance per resolving scope, built there
// so it can see that scope's values, which is how request-scoped services are
// declared once in the root. [Binding.Group] and [Scope.All] handle groups,
// and [Scope.Maybe] resolves an optional dependency from inside a closure.
// [Binding.Needs] says that a parameter of a Wire constructor is one of those
// two — [AllOf] for a []T holding the group for T, [Optional] for a T that may
// go unprovided — so a constructor that takes either is still a plain function
// and its dependencies are still declared. An interface is served by a
// constructor that returns the implementation, since Wire accepts any result
// assignable to the key: s.Wire[Reader](NewRepo).
//
// # Scopes
//
// [Scope.Child] creates a scope that resolves through its parent, reuses the
// parent's singletons and owns the lifecycle of what it builds. A child may
// shadow a key its parent provides; within one scope, a second registration
// of a key must be marked [Binding.Override], or the next resolution rejects
// it naming both sites. That marker is the test seam: wire the production
// graph into a fresh scope, then override what you want faked before anything
// is resolved ([Test] does the bookkeeping). For HTTP,
// [golang.yandex/di/dihttp.Middleware] gives each request a child
// scope holding the *http.Request, reachable through [FromContext].
//
// # Modules
//
// A [Module] is a function that registers into a scope, and [Scope.Use]
// applies modules in order. Registrations are attributed to the module that
// made them, so a collision between two modules is reported as one: "*app.DB
// is provided at storage (wire.go:12) and again at caching (cache.go:8)".
//
// # Lifecycle
//
// [Binding.OnStart], [Binding.OnDrain] and [Binding.OnStop] are typed hooks,
// one of each per binding. [Scope.Start] builds [Binding.Eager] bindings and
// runs start hooks in build order, rolling back on failure; services built
// later start as part of being built. [Scope.Stop] first drains, which lets
// work already in flight finish while the scope still resolves, then stops
// child scopes, then services in reverse build order, and afterwards the scope
// refuses to resolve anything. [Binding.Go] runs a worker, a long-lived
// function in a goroutine of its own, cancelled on stop. [Scope.Run] ties it
// together for a main function: start within [StartTimeout], wait for a signal
// or [Scope.Shutdown], stop within [StopTimeout].
// [Scope.Observe] reports every step for logging and metrics.
//
// # Inspecting the graph
//
// A constructor's dependencies are recorded as it resolves them, so the graph
// is known for whatever has been built. [Scope.Explain] renders one service's
// dependency tree, with the registration site, lifetime and scope of each
// node, and what needed it. [Scope.Graph] renders everything built in a scope
// and its descendants as Graphviz DOT.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// A [Scope] is safe to use from many goroutines, including from goroutines a
// constructor starts for itself: the resolution path is immutable, so
// branches that run in parallel share nothing. A constructor may also keep
// the Scope it was handed and resolve through it later, once its own service
// is built; the finished part of that path is no longer a dependency, so such
// a resolution is not a cycle. A service is built once however many
// resolutions race for it, and a resolution of a running scope returns only a
// service whose start step has finished. A cycle is reported as [ErrCycle]
// even when the two halves are being built concurrently.
//
// Three re-entrancy limits apply. A goroutine started by a constructor must
// use [Scope.Resolve] rather than [Scope.Get], because Get reports failure by
// panicking and that panic cannot unwind to the enclosing call from another
// goroutine. An [Binding.OnStart] hook must not resolve a service that
// depends on the one being started: the hook already holds the value, and
// waiting for itself cannot make progress. And no hook may call [Scope.Stop]
// on its own scope or an ancestor, because Stop waits for the very step the
// hook is running; call [Scope.Shutdown], which never blocks.
