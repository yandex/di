# digrpc

`google.golang.org/grpc` on a [`golang.yandex/di`](https://github.com/yandex/di)
scope. A separate module, so the library itself stays dependency-free.

```sh
go get golang.yandex/di/digrpc
```

`Interceptor` opens a child scope per call holding a `*digrpc.Call` — the full
method name and the context the call arrived with, so its metadata, peer and
deadline are all there. The scope is attached to the handler's context and
stopped when the handler returns. `Module` registers the interceptor, so a
constructor can take one:

```go
func NewServer(ic digrpc.Interceptor) *grpc.Server {
	srv := grpc.NewServer(ic.Options()...)
	digrpc.Register[*Users](srv, &pb.Users_ServiceDesc)
	return srv
}
```

```go
app := di.New()
app.Use(digrpc.Module)
app.Wire[*Users](NewUsers).Scoped() // takes the *digrpc.Call, so built per call
app.Wire[*grpc.Server](NewServer)
```

There are two ways for a service to reach the call's scope. Registered the
generated way, with `pb.RegisterUsersServer`, it is one value for the whole
server and reads the scope off the context it is handed, with
`di.FromContext`. `Register[H]` instead resolves the implementation from each
call's scope, so it is a service like any other: `Scoped()` when it takes the
call, built after the server's interceptors have run, and a constructor
returning a status error fails the call with that status.

A call scope is a leaf as far as the declared graph goes, so validate it as
one:

```go
app.Validate(di.Provided[*digrpc.Call]()).Err()
```

`Serve` gives the server its lifecycle, on whatever listener you return:

```go
var lc net.ListenConfig
digrpc.Serve(app.Wire[*grpc.Server](NewServer), func(ctx context.Context) (net.Listener, error) {
	return lc.Listen(ctx, "tcp", ":50051")
})
```

It makes the binding eager and takes every hook: `OnStart` calls `listen`, so
a busy port fails the start; a worker serves once the whole start has
succeeded (`di.Scope.Ready`), so a start that rolls back serves no call;
`OnDrain` calls `GracefulStop`, which runs before anything is torn down, so
calls still in flight keep their scopes; `OnStop` calls `Stop`. A `bufconn`
listener works the same, which is how its tests run. A second server in the
same scope is registered under a type of its own, `type AdminServer
*grpc.Server`, and served by the same call; its constructor still returns
`*grpc.Server`. `examples/grpc` in the
main repository is that program end to end.

Versioned on its own as `digrpc/vX.Y.Z`, against a released `di`; bumping that
requirement is how it picks up a library change. Its tests serve grpc's own
health service over `bufconn`, so nothing here is generated from protobuf.

```sh
cd digrpc && go test -race ./... && golangci-lint run ./...
```
